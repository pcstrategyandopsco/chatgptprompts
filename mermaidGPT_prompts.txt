Start by asking questions first.

Recommended prompt:

The course content is moving from a prescribed path through course elements to a student-led experience where users can select elements to work through. Once they have completed a fixed number of courses, they are invited to complete an assessment to obtain a certificate of achievement.
At a high level, the experience is described as 
structuring up a year-long program that includes some live online sessions, maybe 2 per term, which is only 8 per year (we have 4 terms per year) - 
Term 1 = planning; 
Term 2 = Classroom management; 
Term 3 = Formative assessment; 
Term 4 = Feedback. 

Teachers can join at any point in the year but it is a closed group.
Teachers upload some samples of their work for feedback. 

I would like the upload area to include a permission to share and publish check button
teachers share a link to short videos of their teaching in their classroom. 
This would need to address the privacy of kids, so it would be better if they keep the video in their own domain and share a link with a closed group.
